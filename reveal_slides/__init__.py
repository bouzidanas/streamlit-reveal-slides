## Installation
`pip install streamlit-reveal-slides`

\[[GitHub](https://github.com/bouzidanas/streamlit.io/tree/7748c2a97f4ca54ce4b8120a054d6c66e8be296d/streamlit-reveal-slides)\] \[[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-reveal-slides/)\]
---
## Presentation Features
- Create slides from markdown or markup <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Touch, mouse, and keyboard navigation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Fullscreen and overview modes <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Search and Zoom (plugins) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Display LaTeX and syntax highlighted code (plugins) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
---
## Slide Content Creation
A paragraph with some text and a markdown [link](https://hakim.se). 
Markdown links get displayed within the parent iframe.
--
Another paragraph containing the same <a target="_blank" href="https://hakim.se">link</a>.
However, this link will open in a new tab instead. 
This is done using an HTML `<a>` tag with `target="_blank"`.
---
## Backgrounds
Reveal supports four different types of backgrounds: color, image, video and iframe.
--
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#283747" -->
Change the background to a solid color using the `data-background-color` attribute.
--
<!-- .slide: data-background-video="https://bouzidanas.github.io/videos/pexels-cottonbro-9665235.mp4" data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted -->
Add a video as the background using the `data-background-video` attribute. Add `data-background-video-loop` to loop the video in the background and add `data-background-video-muted` to mute it.
---
## Math Expressions
This following is an example of an inline math equation: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.
--
## The Lorenz Equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\\\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\\\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
$$
---
## Code blocks
```js [1-2|3|4]
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = x => 1 + 2 + x;
c(3);
```
---
## Slide Fragments
This sentence is placed in a fragment with `data-fragment-index="0"` 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

This is the third fragment in the slide that will appear because `data-fragment-index` is set to `1` 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

This sentence appears by default when you transition into and out of this slide 
---
## Configuring the Presentation
The presentation can be configured using the `config` parameter. Its as simple as passing a dictionary with the reveal configuration options.
